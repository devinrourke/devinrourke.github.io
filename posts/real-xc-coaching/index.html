  <div>
    <p>You might think coaching high school XC is all about rallying the troops, shouting encouraging words, and yelling splits at the mile mark. Well there's a lot more that goes into it than that:</p>
<h3>1. Bus scheduler, driver</h3>
<p>Picture a typical yellow school bus. Now picutre a short bus, about half the size. We often use those to cart 15 or fewer kiddos to meets. It saves the district money because they don't have to <strong>employ</strong> a school bus driver. Instead, they pin that task on the XC coach! If instead we want to use a big yellow school bus, it requires approximately a billion sign-offs and a quarter inch of paperwork.</p>
<h3>2. Crowd management</h3>
<p>Our Home XC meet now draws 30 HS teams, 15 MS teams, family, friends, spectators and participants. Beginning at 4am, we mark the course and prapare the park for the onslaught of people. By noon, its like no one was ever there. During the meet, well-over 3,000 people pack into a tiny neighborhood park and race on collision courses through crowds of people. Stressful is a massive understatement.</p>
<p>The most obscure tasks?:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remind the parks guys to turn off the sprinklers the morning prior, so the 1,500 runners don't turn the place into a mud pit.</li>
<li>Buy extra TP for the porta johns.</li>
<li>Call the city to ask for extra police patrol, and have an ambulance on standby.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Travel agent</h3>
<p>Booking tax-exempt hotel rooms, flights, rental vans and food for a group of 20 or more is not easy, but there are tricks of the trade. It is a godsend when a hotel's front desk agent has dealt with a school group before and knows that I can't give them a list of names for every room a month before our arrival date because I don't even know if we qualified for the meet yet, let alone which athletes earn a spot. You know its going to be a long phone call when the hotel's booking agent asks "a tax-exempt what??"</p>
<h3>4. Website, e-mail list content management</h3>
<p>Google to the rescue. If you are an XC coach and you haven't discovered Google Groups, Google Docs, Google Sites, and Google Forms, you're going to have a bad time. Get on-board with Google. There's often a 'share' button in the upper right, which means "share all of this burden with someone else". </p>
<h3>5. Psychologist</h3>
<p>Simply talking about injuries usually brings about more of them at practice the next day. Reverse psychology, direct psychology, inverse, left, right.. I've used them all. Coaching (like teaching) is about building relationships, and how best to do that depends on the person. So, you quickly learn which kiddos respond to different amounts and types of attention. To get everyone ticking along in the same productive and positive mentality doesn't happen often, but when it does, you know it. There are good and bad practices, every week.</p>
<h3>6. Family therapist</h3>
<p>In the past 8 years, I have learned a <em>lot</em> about effective parenting. What to do, what not to do once I'm a dad. For example, Do: cheer on your kid from the sidelines, support every part of their lives, and say "thanks for everything you do, coach!". Don't: join the team in the pre-race pump-up chant or scold your kid for not winning gold in the damn Olympics.</p>
<h3>7. Public relations</h3>
<p>Writing emails is not hard. Writing accurate, informative, brief emails is incredibly difficult, and takes an order of magnitude more time. There is no such thing as a small mistake when it comes to announcing a varsity squad or awarding "most-valuable" honors. These are moments that will be remembered forever, for the better or for the worse.</p>
